# Project Budget Manager

### Overview

A mini project where you are able to track a projects buget. When the user creates a new project they set the budget and the hourly rate. The user can then add used hours on the project. A report is then generated to show the overall budget, remaining budget and hours used.

I created this project to practise new skills:

- ASP.NET
- Entity Framework
- Azure SQL Database

### Challenges

- Ensuring that when connected to the database the migration and seed data was running if the table did not exist.
- Deciding whether to do the business logic in my backend for the SQL queries or in the front.
- Learning the different ways to connect to Azure SQL DB and which way is the most secure.
